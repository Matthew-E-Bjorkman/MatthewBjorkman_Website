                            technologies and languages so while I am a full-stack developer with functional HTML/CSS/JS language understanding 
                            that's also about where my experience ended. This project was a way for me to undertake and learn Angular, Web Hosting, 
                            and everything else that goes into publishing a website."

                            As a developer this mostly manifests in the implementation and integration with various payment processors into our native systems and workflows.
                            My experience also goes beyond the basics of Credit Card, ACH, and the American market. 
                            I've worked on systems in other countries such as Canada, Austria, and Germany while supporting many of their unique payment methods. 
                            Some examples are Local Payment Methods (E.g. SEPA) and Pre-Authorized Debit."

                            a project I was able to undertake was migrating a largely manual SQL migration process to an automated system utilizing DBUp.
                            This system was integrated with our deployment tool to, on a deployment, handle the SQL migration from the old build to the new version.
                            There were 2 main workflows for this process. The first was to parse through developer-written scripts, 
                            identify if their content has been ran against that environment's database server, and if not execute and log the script. 
                            An html report with the outcome of this process was also generated and sent to stakeholders via an email API integration.
                            The other workflow was to take these same scripts and condense them down to a single manifest script that would represent 
                            the total delta between the existing state of the database schema and shared data and that of the build being deployed."

                            At the start of the project we had no testing of this code area sans some manual QA test cases. To combat this, 
                            I instantiated a new Postman collection holding a request object for every api endpoint in our suite. Each request had variables and sample bodies corresponding to the request properties accepted by the API. 
                            By combining this with multiple environments, javascript-driven Postman Monitor test cases, and internal training seasons and guidance I was able to help us launch a fully automated API E2E test suite."
