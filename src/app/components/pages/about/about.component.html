                            but didn't quite have the drive or technical knowledge to undertake. My career has been mostly rooted in back-end 
                            technologies and languages so while I am a full-stack developer with functional HTML/CSS/JS language understanding 
                            that's also about where my experience ended. This project was a way for me to undertake and learn Angular, Web Hosting, 
                            and everything else that goes into publishing a website."
